# Aero Decision Log

## DEC-001 — Stability is evidence-based, not label-based

- Date: 2026-08-02
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Treat the repository and all unaudited features as experimental until
  their rows satisfy the gates in `SPEC_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md`. Historical
  `1.0.0` labels do not establish stability.
- Evidence: `src/compiler/Cargo.toml` declares `0.3.0`; README and CLI declare
  `1.0.0`; README also calls the repository experimental. Stable-release gates
  have not been demonstrated in the current audit.
- Alternatives rejected: accepting the largest existing version label; changing
  package or CLI versions before completing the compatibility audit.
- Compatibility consequences: none yet. A later version unification requires a
  documented migration/release decision and tests.
- Revisit when: the capability audit and version policy are complete, or all 1.0
  release gates are satisfied.

## DEC-002 — Determinism checks are regression evidence, not formal proof

- Date: 2026-08-02
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Keep deterministic lexer/parser/IR/lowering checks, but classify them
  as executable regression checks. Do not call them mechanized formal-semantics
  proofs without a proof system, model, and checked correspondence.
- Evidence: the current conformance report contains three program cases and four
  equality-by-repetition checks implemented in `src/compiler/src/conformance.rs`.
- Alternatives rejected: deleting useful checks; treating repeatability as proof.
- Compatibility consequences: documentation terminology may need correction;
  executable behavior does not change.
- Revisit when: Aero adopts an explicit formalization and machine-checked proof
  workflow connected to compiler behavior.

## DEC-003 — One canonical compiler pipeline

- Date: 2026-08-02
- Status: direction accepted; implementation pending audit
- Decision: The library will be the canonical compiler implementation. The CLI,
  LSP, benchmarks, and other tools should consume shared library phase APIs and
  options rather than compiling through separately declared module copies.
- Evidence: `src/compiler/src/lib.rs` and `src/compiler/src/main.rs` independently
  declare overlapping compiler modules; current behavior can diverge silently.
- Alternatives rejected: maintaining parallel pipelines; making the binary the
  canonical API and leaving library consumers approximate.
- Compatibility consequences: internal imports and visibility will change; CLI
  behavior must be locked by regression tests before refactoring.
- Revisit when: audit shows a component cannot safely be shared without a
  deliberate query/API boundary.
