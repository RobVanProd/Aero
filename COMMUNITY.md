# Community and Communication

This document outlines the communication channels and community guidelines for the Aero programming language project.

## Communication Channels

[Placeholder: Details about the chosen communication platform (e.g., Discourse, Zulip, Discord) will be added here once established. This platform will be used for general discussions, Q&A, and the Request for Comments (RFC) process.]

## Request for Comments (RFC) Process

The RFC process is a way for the Aero community to propose, discuss, and approve significant changes to the language, compiler, and ecosystem. Details of this process will be formalized and published on the chosen communication platform.
