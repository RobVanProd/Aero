## Phase 1: Formalize the Core Language Specification

- [x] Create a formal grammar document (EBNF)
- [x] Detail the type system rules
- [x] Define the ownership and borrowing model

## Phase 2: Establish Project Infrastructure

- [x] Create a public Git repository
- [x] Adopt a permissive open-source license
- [x] Establish a communication channel
- [x] Adopt a Code of Conduct

## Phase 3: Develop the Bootstrap Compiler Prototype

- [x] Implement the Frontend
  - [x] Lexer & Parser
  - [x] Semantic Analysis
- [x] Implement the Backend
  - [x] Intermediate Representation (IR)
  - [x] Code Generation

## Phase 4: Implement Foundational Benchmarks

- [x] Select initial benchmarks
- [x] Develop a rigorous measurement process
- [x] Create a simple benchmarking harness

## Phase 5: Create Comprehensive README

- [x] Create Comprehensive README

## Phase 6: Setup CI/CD and Roadmap

- [x] Setup GitHub Actions CI
- [x] Create Roadmap.md

## Phase 7: Implement Frontend - Variables & Expressions

- [x] Implement tokens & variable grammar (Lexer â†’ Parser)
- [x] Land first passing test: let x = 3 + 4; should JIT-execute to exit-code 7.

## Phase 8: Implement Mid-end - Typed IR

- [x] IR design: simple SSA-ish struct
- [x] Lowering pass: AST â†’ IR with fresh-register allocator.
- [x] Constant-folding (optional but tiny win).

## Phase 9: Implement Backend - LLVM IR (String Output)

- [x] Generate LLVM IR as a string for simple programs.
- [x] Update `main.rs` to call the modified `code_generator.rs` and print the generated LLVM IR string.
- [x] Create a simple test case (e.g., `let x = 3 + 4;`) and verify that the generated LLVM IR string is correct and can be compiled externally (e.g., using `llc` and `clang` in the sandbox).

## Phase 10: Stack-allocated variables & alloca / store / load

- [x] IR tweak: Give each let a virtual stack slot ID. Lower to: %ptr0 = alloca i64, store i64 %r0, i64* %ptr0, %r1 = load i64, i64* %ptr0
- [x] Code-gen string: Add helpers: fn fresh_reg() -> String and fn fresh_ptr() -> String so the emitter never re-uses names.
- [x] Semantic pass: Track VarInfo { ptr_name, ty } in a HashMap. Emit "use-before-init" diagnostics when a load occurs without a prior store.
- [x] CI test: New example: let a = 2; let b = a * 3; Assert IR compiles & the exit code is 6.
- [x] Enhanced code generator with proper register management
- [x] Updated CI pipeline with comprehensive test cases
- [x] All tests passing with correct exit codes (return15 â†’ 15, variables â†’ 6)
## Phase 11: Type-correct arithmetic with proper int/float distinction

- [x] Phase 11.1 - Lexer and Parser enhancements for float literals

  - [x] Updated parser to handle float literals and include type field in Binary expressions
- [x] Phase 11.2 - Type system extension with Ty enum and binary expression typing
  - [x] Created types.rs module with Ty enum (Int, Float)
  - [x] Added type inference and promotion rules for binary operations
  - [x] Updated AST to include type information in Binary expressions
- [x] Phase 11.3 - Semantic checks for type promotion and validation
  - [x] Enhanced semantic analyzer with proper type system integration
  - [x] Implemented type inference and validation for expressions
  - [x] Added type promotion rules (int + float â†’ float)
- [x] Phase 11.4 - IR lowering with proper int/float operations
  - [x] Updated IR generator with type-aware code generation
  - [x] Added proper int/float instruction selection (Add vs FAdd, etc.)
  - [x] Implemented type promotion with SIToFP instructions
- [x] Phase 11.5 - Runtime conversions and return type handling
  - [x] Updated code generator to handle FPToSI conversion for float return values
  - [x] Fixed LLVM IR generation for proper type handling
  - [x] Added support for mixed arithmetic operations
- [x] Phase 11.6 - Comprehensive testing and CI integration
  - [x] Created mixed.aero test case (3 + 4.5 â†’ exit code 7)
  - [x] Created float_ops.aero test case (2.5 * 3.0 â†’ exit code 7)
  - [x] Updated CI pipeline with new test cases
  - [x] All tests passing with correct exit codes

## Phase 12: Final MVP Polish and Completion

- [x] Phase 12.1 - Missing example files and CI fixes
  - [x] Created return15.aero example (10 + 5 â†’ exit code 15)
  - [x] Created variables.aero example (2 * 3 â†’ exit code 6)
  - [x] Fixed CI pipeline to use correct example files
- [x] Phase 12.2 - CLI improvements and user experience
  - [x] Fixed binary name from "compiler" to "aero" in Cargo.toml
  - [x] Added --help and --version command line flags
  - [x] Enhanced help message with usage examples
  - [x] Implemented proper aero run command with execution
- [x] Phase 12.3 - Code generation fixes and type consistency
