# Aero Project State

Last updated: 2026-08-02 (America/New_York)

## Current objective

Milestone 1 — `CORE-002`, the fallible-lexing boundary for silent source corruption,
after closing fatal parser propagation across public compiler paths.

## Active hypothesis

An additive fallible lexer API used by trusted compilation entry points can reject
unexpected characters, invalid numeric literals, and unterminated strings without
changing the legacy lexer API or accepted-token semantics in the first slice.

## Repository state

- Upstream: `https://github.com/RobVanProd/aero.git`
- Default branch: `master`
- Starting commit: `8f8c7337a4008082fd2a443fcc814b5847b8663f`
- Starting commit date: `2026-05-28T21:13:40-04:00`
- Current branch: `agent/aero-integration`
- Current commit: `379ec1e61860f16c7e6940ebaa6771c01a2356c2`
- Last verified commit: `379ec1e61860f16c7e6940ebaa6771c01a2356c2`
- Worktree: clean. Initial `CORE-002` implementation is integrated and passes the
  full gate; independent review requested a preregistered closure amendment.

## Environment and verification

- Host: Windows x86_64
- Shell for baseline gate: Git Bash launched from PowerShell
- Rust: `rustc 1.97.1 (8bab26f4f 2026-07-14)`
- Cargo: `cargo 1.97.1 (c980f4866 2026-06-30)`
- Required command: `./tools/test.sh`
- Windows invocation used: prepend `C:\Users\usa50\.cargo\bin` to `PATH`, then
  run Git Bash with `./tools/test.sh`.
- Baseline result: PASS on the starting commit; formatting, Clippy correctness,
  unit/integration tests, and doc tests completed with no test failures.
- Initial environment issue: Rust was absent and the first two baseline attempts
  stopped at `cargo: command not found`; the stable minimal toolchain plus
  `rustfmt` and `clippy` were installed, then the gate passed.
- LLVM tools in the Windows environment: `clang`, `llc`, `opt`, and `llvm-as`
  unavailable on discovered paths.
- Upstream recheck before `CORE-001`: `origin/master` still equals the recorded
  starting commit.
- Remote CI: CI run `26611985062`, Rust CI run `26611985038`, and latest CodeQL
  run `30685526232` all completed successfully for upstream commit
  `8f8c7337a4008082fd2a443fcc814b5847b8663f`.
- `CORE-001B` verification at `6ce85922`: focused fatal-parse tests 11/11;
  complete gate PASS with 106 library, 111 binary, and 59 frontend tests; 38
  pre-existing phase-five tests remain ignored.
- Fresh manual root and imported-module builds both exited 1, reported the source
  file at `1:5`, and created no requested LLVM artifact.

## Audit agents

- `AUDIT-001` specification: complete; 3 high, 6 medium, 1 low finding.
- `AUDIT-002` frontend: complete; silent lexical corruption, lost semantics/spans,
  recovery/API panic risks, and dormant coverage confirmed.
- `AUDIT-003` type soundness: complete; active integer/double/zero fallbacks,
  unenforced contracts, ownership/generic gaps, and scope leakage confirmed.
- `AUDIT-004` IR/code generation: complete; untyped values, invalid boolean/CFG
  lowering, parse-to-invalid-LLVM false success, and absent verification confirmed.
- `AUDIT-005` runtime/backends: complete; CPU execution path separated from ROCm
  object plumbing and absent CUDA run; graph/quantization claims reclassified.
- `AUDIT-006` tooling: complete; duplicate pipelines, ignored options, status-code
  failures, heuristic LSP, shallow modules, and registry risks confirmed.
- `AUDIT-007` tests/fuzzing: complete; duplicates, 38 ignored, 299 dormant, and
  absent compile-fail/fuzz/differential/verifier/hardware gates inventoried.
- `AUDIT-008` benchmarks/claims: complete; compilation series invalid, lexer
  evidence partial, GGUF external/single-run, and protocol gaps classified.

## Current capability classification

Initial audit classification; see `CURRENT_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md` and
`SPEC_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md` for stage evidence:

- Compiler regression baseline: passing locally.
- Repository stability: experimental.
- Formal conformance: three example cases plus four deterministic pipeline
  checks; this is not formal semantics proof.
- CPU source-to-LLVM/object/link/process path: present when external tools are
  available; current evidence is four small Linux CI programs.
- ROCm: interface/retarget/object-generation plumbing; no link/launch path or
  current-session hardware execution evidence.
- CUDA: selectable interface; CLI source states run support is not implemented.
- Public version: inconsistent (`0.3.0` package versus `1.0.0` README/CLI).
- Library compiler options: accepted but ignored by `compile_program`.
- Compiler architecture: binary and library declare overlapping modules.

## Known blockers and regressions

- No known baseline regression.
- The local shell required Rust installation before tests could run.
- Real backend verification may be blocked by absent LLVM/GPU toolchains or
  hardware; absence will be recorded rather than simulated.
- `run_aero_program` still calls `exit` internally after a valid CPU process;
  this pre-existing hidden termination violates the desired helper/API boundary
  and remains a separate tooling task.
- The trusted compiler still uses an infallible lexer that skips or substitutes
  malformed input; parser closure does not control lexical corruption.

## Exact next action

Commit the `CORE-002` review amendment, create a fresh isolated closure worktree,
and assign the same sole owner to conformance/doc/LSP corrections and regressions.

## Unauthorized actions

Do not publish releases/packages/registry changes/benchmark claims; force-push or
rewrite history; delete substantial evidence; change the language's fundamental
identity; make incompatible syntax/semantics changes without a migration plan;
modify downstream repositories; spend money; use unbounded paid compute; handle
credentials; or perform destructive system operations.
