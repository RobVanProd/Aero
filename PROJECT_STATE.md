# Aero Project State

Last updated: 2026-08-02 (America/New_York)

## Current objective

Milestone 3 — correct the IR lexical-scope blocker found during independent review
of the initialized numeric binding-annotation contract `CORE-004`.

## Active hypothesis

Exact semantic annotation checks plus complete restoration of the IR generator's
existing flat symbol-table snapshot at lexical scope exits can preserve numeric
binding contracts and nested shadowing without a typed IR redesign.

## Repository state

- Upstream: `https://github.com/RobVanProd/aero.git`
- Default branch: `master`
- Starting commit: `8f8c7337a4008082fd2a443fcc814b5847b8663f`
- Starting commit date: `2026-05-28T21:13:40-04:00`
- Current branch: `agent/aero-integration`
- Current commit: `5fa5a5eba41ce33fcf06767992efa1b810f9ebaa`
- Last verified commit: `8d5d8e7cc92f712fccc3af65cc4f06a1d7b1dd9a`
- Worktree: clean before the `CORE-004` review amendment. The first semantic
  candidate passes its 12 focused tests and the owner's full gate, but both
  independent reviewers reject it for a downstream nested-shadow IR miscompile.

## Environment and verification

- Host: Windows x86_64
- Shell for baseline gate: Git Bash launched from PowerShell
- Rust: `rustc 1.97.1 (8bab26f4f 2026-07-14)`
- Cargo: `cargo 1.97.1 (c980f4866 2026-06-30)`
- Required command: `./tools/test.sh`
- Windows invocation used: prepend `C:\Users\usa50\.cargo\bin` to `PATH`, then
  run Git Bash with `./tools/test.sh`.
- Baseline result: PASS on the starting commit; formatting, Clippy correctness,
  unit/integration tests, and doc tests completed with no test failures.
- Initial environment issue: Rust was absent and the first two baseline attempts
  stopped at `cargo: command not found`; the stable minimal toolchain plus
  `rustfmt` and `clippy` were installed, then the gate passed.
- LLVM tools in the Windows environment: `clang`, `llc`, `opt`, and `llvm-as`
  unavailable on discovered paths.
- Upstream recheck before `CORE-001`: `origin/master` still equals the recorded
  starting commit.
- Remote CI: CI run `26611985062`, Rust CI run `26611985038`, and latest CodeQL
  run `30685526232` all completed successfully for upstream commit
  `8f8c7337a4008082fd2a443fcc814b5847b8663f`.
- `CORE-001B` verification at `6ce85922`: focused fatal-parse tests 11/11;
  complete gate PASS with 106 library, 111 binary, and 59 frontend tests; 38
  pre-existing phase-five tests remain ignored.
- Fresh manual root and imported-module builds both exited 1, reported the source
  file at `1:5`, and created no requested LLVM artifact.
- `CORE-002` verification at `b988318`: full gate PASS with 111 library, 118
  binary, 11 fatal-parse, 12 strict-lexing, and 59 frontend tests; 38 pre-existing
  phase-five tests remain ignored. Conformance remains 3/3 cases and 4/4 checks.
- Fresh manual unexpected-character and overflow builds, plus direct-module docs,
  exited 1 with located lexical errors and created no requested output.
- `CORE-003` verification at `8d5d8e7`: focused function-contract tests 13/13;
  full gate PASS with 112 library, 119 binary, 11 fatal-parse, 59 frontend,
  13 function-contract, and 12 strict-lex tests. The 38 pre-existing phase-five
  tests remain ignored. Two independent reviewers approved the exact clean SHA;
  fresh black-box invalid-program probes exited nonzero and wrote no LLVM artifact.

## Audit agents

- `AUDIT-001` specification: complete; 3 high, 6 medium, 1 low finding.
- `AUDIT-002` frontend: complete; silent lexical corruption, lost semantics/spans,
  recovery/API panic risks, and dormant coverage confirmed.
- `AUDIT-003` type soundness: complete; active integer/double/zero fallbacks,
  unenforced contracts, ownership/generic gaps, and scope leakage confirmed.
- `AUDIT-004` IR/code generation: complete; untyped values, invalid boolean/CFG
  lowering, parse-to-invalid-LLVM false success, and absent verification confirmed.
- `AUDIT-005` runtime/backends: complete; CPU execution path separated from ROCm
  object plumbing and absent CUDA run; graph/quantization claims reclassified.
- `AUDIT-006` tooling: complete; duplicate pipelines, ignored options, status-code
  failures, heuristic LSP, shallow modules, and registry risks confirmed.
- `AUDIT-007` tests/fuzzing: complete; duplicates, 38 ignored, 299 dormant, and
  absent compile-fail/fuzz/differential/verifier/hardware gates inventoried.
- `AUDIT-008` benchmarks/claims: complete; compilation series invalid, lexer
  evidence partial, GGUF external/single-run, and protocol gaps classified.
- `AUDIT-009` numeric binding boundary: amended; parser retention, semantic/IR
  discard, seven black-box false-accept families, unified-double local storage,
  and scalar lexical-scope leakage are characterized. Semantic-only enforcement
  was proven insufficient for valid nested shadowing.

## Current capability classification

Initial audit classification; see `CURRENT_CAPABILITY_AUDIT.md` and
`SPEC_IMPLEMENTATION_MATRIX.md` for stage evidence:

- Compiler regression baseline: passing locally.
- Repository stability: experimental.
- Formal conformance: three example cases plus four deterministic pipeline
  checks; this is not formal semantics proof.
- CPU source-to-LLVM/object/link/process path: present when external tools are
  available; current evidence is four small Linux CI programs.
- ROCm: interface/retarget/object-generation plumbing; no link/launch path or
  current-session hardware execution evidence.
- CUDA: selectable interface; CLI source states run support is not implemented.
- Public version: inconsistent (`0.3.0` package versus `1.0.0` README/CLI).
- Library compiler options: accepted but ignored by `compile_program`.
- Compiler architecture: binary and library declare overlapping modules.

## Known blockers and regressions

- No known baseline regression.
- The local shell required Rust installation before tests could run.
- Real backend verification may be blocked by absent LLVM/GPU toolchains or
  hardware; absence will be recorded rather than simulated.
- `run_aero_program` still calls `exit` internally after a valid CPU process;
  this pre-existing hidden termination violates the desired helper/API boundary
  and remains a separate tooling task.
- Legacy recovery lexing remains public for compatibility and LSP symbol recovery;
  trusted repository paths no longer feed it into semantics, IR, or artifacts.
- Numeric and void top-level function contracts are controlled at `8d5d8e7`.
  Boolean/generic/composite signatures and numeric `let` annotations remain open.
- Function-local branch and epilogue termination improved in `CORE-003`, but the
  broader pre-existing unreachable-after-terminator CFG risk remains open.
- `CORE-004` candidate `5fa5a5e` rejects numeric annotation mismatches but is not
  accepted: nested scalar shadowing can lower a post-block use to the inner slot.

## Exact next action

Add the preregistered failing LLVM scope-restoration regressions on the isolated
owner branch, then minimally generalize IR snapshot restoration from callables to
all bindings and resubmit an exact clean candidate for two independent reviews.

## Unauthorized actions

Do not publish releases/packages/registry changes/benchmark claims; force-push or
rewrite history; delete substantial evidence; change the language's fundamental
identity; make incompatible syntax/semantics changes without a migration plan;
modify downstream repositories; spend money; use unbounded paid compute; handle
credentials; or perform destructive system operations.
