# Phase 3: Core Language Features - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing core language features that will transform Aero from a basic arithmetic calculator into a functional programming language. Phase 3 focuses on the fundamental constructs needed for real program development: functions, control flow, and basic I/O operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Function Definitions and Calls

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define and call functions so that I can organize my code into reusable components and build modular programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define a function with `fn function_name() { }` syntax THEN the compiler SHALL parse and store the function definition in the AST
2. WHEN I define a function with parameters `fn add(a: i32, b: i32)` THEN the compiler SHALL validate parameter types and names
3. WHEN I define a function with a return type `fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32` THEN the compiler SHALL enforce return type consistency
4. WHEN I call a function `add(5, 3)` THEN the compiler SHALL generate correct function call IR and LLVM code
5. WHEN I call a function with wrong number of arguments THEN the compiler SHALL report an arity error
6. WHEN I call a function with wrong argument types THEN the compiler SHALL report a type mismatch error
7. WHEN a function returns a value THEN the calling code SHALL receive the correct return value
8. WHEN a function has no explicit return THEN it SHALL implicitly return the unit type `()`

### Requirement 2: Control Flow Statements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use if/else statements and loops so that I can implement conditional logic and iteration in my programs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write `if condition { block }` THEN the compiler SHALL evaluate the condition and execute the block only if true
2. WHEN I write `if condition { block1 } else { block2 }` THEN the compiler SHALL execute block1 if condition is true, otherwise block2
3. WHEN I write `if condition1 { } else if condition2 { } else { }` THEN the compiler SHALL handle chained conditionals correctly
4. WHEN I write `while condition { block }` THEN the compiler SHALL repeatedly execute the block while condition is true
5. WHEN I write `for i in range { block }` THEN the compiler SHALL iterate over the range and execute the block for each value
6. WHEN I write `loop { block }` THEN the compiler SHALL create an infinite loop that can be exited with break
7. WHEN I use `break` in a loop THEN the compiler SHALL exit the innermost loop
8. WHEN I use `continue` in a loop THEN the compiler SHALL skip to the next iteration
9. WHEN control flow conditions are not boolean THEN the compiler SHALL report a type error

### Requirement 3: Basic I/O Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to print output and read input so that I can create interactive programs and debug my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use `print!("Hello")` THEN the program SHALL output "Hello" without a newline
2. WHEN I use `println!("Hello")` THEN the program SHALL output "Hello" followed by a newline
3. WHEN I use `print!("Value: {}", x)` THEN the program SHALL format and output the variable x
4. WHEN I use `println!("Sum: {}", a + b)` THEN the program SHALL evaluate the expression and format the result
5. WHEN I use multiple format placeholders `println!("{} + {} = {}", a, b, a+b)` THEN all values SHALL be formatted correctly
6. WHEN I call print functions THEN they SHALL work with all basic types (int, float, bool, string)
7. WHEN print functions encounter formatting errors THEN the compiler SHALL report clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Variable System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper variable scoping and mutability controls so that I can write safe and predictable code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I declare `let mut x = 5` THEN the variable SHALL be mutable and allow reassignment
2. WHEN I declare `let x = 5` THEN the variable SHALL be immutable and prevent reassignment
3. WHEN I try to reassign an immutable variable THEN the compiler SHALL report a mutability error
4. WHEN I declare variables in nested blocks THEN inner scopes SHALL shadow outer variables correctly
5. WHEN I access a variable THEN the compiler SHALL resolve to the correct scope
6. WHEN I use a variable before declaration THEN the compiler SHALL report an undefined variable error
7. WHEN I declare a variable with explicit type `let x: i32 = 5` THEN the compiler SHALL enforce the specified type

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Type System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want explicit type annotations and better type checking so that I can write more robust code with clear interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify explicit types `let x: i32 = 5` THEN the compiler SHALL validate type compatibility
2. WHEN I mix incompatible types without promotion THEN the compiler SHALL report type errors
3. WHEN I use comparison operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` THEN the compiler SHALL generate correct boolean results
4. WHEN I use logical operators `&&`, `||`, `!` THEN the compiler SHALL handle boolean logic correctly
5. WHEN I use bitwise operators `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>` THEN the compiler SHALL perform correct bit operations
6. WHEN I perform operations on incompatible types THEN the compiler SHALL suggest valid conversions
7. WHEN I use the unit type `()` THEN the compiler SHALL handle it correctly in all contexts

### Requirement 6: Improved Error Reporting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear and helpful error messages so that I can quickly identify and fix issues in my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the compiler encounters an error THEN it SHALL report the exact source location (line and column)
2. WHEN there are syntax errors THEN the compiler SHALL provide suggestions for fixes
3. WHEN there are type errors THEN the compiler SHALL show expected vs actual types
4. WHEN there are semantic errors THEN the compiler SHALL explain the violation clearly
5. WHEN there are multiple errors THEN the compiler SHALL report as many as possible in one pass
6. WHEN errors occur in function calls THEN the compiler SHALL show the function signature
7. WHEN errors involve scoping THEN the compiler SHALL indicate where variables are defined
