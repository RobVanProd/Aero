# Phase 5: Advanced Language Features - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing advanced language features that will make Aero a complete, modern systems programming language. Phase 5 focuses on traits, advanced generics, modules, ownership/borrowing, and memory management features.
