# Aero Programming Language - Complete Development Roadmap

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming Aero from its current Phase 2 MVP state into a complete, production-ready systems programming language. The roadmap is organized into phases that build incrementally upon each other, with each phase adding significant new capabilities.

## Current Status (Phase 2 - Complete ‚úÖ)

Aero has successfully completed Phase 2 MVP with the following capabilities:
- Variables and arithmetic expressions

- Debugging experience is comparable to other systems languages
- Documentation is automatically generated and comprehensive
- Development workflow is smooth and productive

## Phase 8: Production Readiness

**Timeline:** 2-3 months  
**Priority:** Medium - Required for production use

### Key Features
- Stability guarantees and semantic versioning
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Security auditing and vulnerability management
- Performance benchmarking and regression testing
- Memory leak detection and analysis tools
- Production deployment guides and best practices
- Long-term support (LTS) planning

### Success Criteria
- Language is stable enough for production use
- Security vulnerabilities are quickly identified and fixed
- Performance is competitive with C/C++ and Rust
- Production deployment is well-documented

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase builds on previous phases
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing at every level
3. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and validation
4. **Community Feedback**: Regular feedback collection and incorporation
5. **Documentation-First**: Features are documented as they're implemented

### Quality Assurance
1. **Unit Testing**: Every component has comprehensive unit tests
2. **Integration Testing**: Features work together correctly
3. **Performance Testing**: No performance regressions
4. **Security Testing**: Memory safety and security validation
5. **Compatibility Testing**: Backward compatibility maintained

### Risk Management
1. **Technical Risks**: Complex features like borrow checking may take longer
2. **Scope Creep**: Features may expand beyond initial estimates
3. **Performance Risks**: Optimizations may require significant effort
4. **Compatibility Risks**: Changes may break existing code

## Getting Started

To begin implementing this roadmap:

1. **Review Phase 3 Specifications**: Start with the Phase 3 requirements, design, and tasks
2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Create the phase-3-core-features branch
3. **Begin with Functions**: Start implementing function definitions and calls
4. **Follow the Task List**: Each phase has detailed implementation tasks
5. **Maintain Quality**: Run tests and validate each feature as it's implemented

The roadmap is designed to be flexible - phases can be adjusted based on feedback, technical challenges, and changing priorities. The key is to maintain the incremental approach and ensure each phase is solid before moving to the next.
