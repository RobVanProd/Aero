### Infrastructure
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with comprehensive test matrix
- **Documentation**: Detailed README, roadmap, and language specifications
- **Examples**: Working example programs for testing

- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end validation of I/O and type validation features

## üîß What We Fixed Today

### Missing Example Files
- Created `examples/return15.aero` (returns exit code 15)
- Created `examples/variables.aero` (demonstrates variable usage, returns 6)

### CLI Improvements
- Fixed binary name from `compiler` to `aero` in Cargo.toml
- Added `--help` and `--version` flags
- Enhanced help message with usage examples
- Implemented `aero run` command with automatic compilation and execution

### Code Generation Fixes
- Fixed type consistency issues in LLVM IR generation
- Unified all arithmetic to use `double` type for consistency
- Fixed return value conversion (double ‚Üí i32 for exit codes)
- Corrected type promotion handling

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created `test_compiler.sh` (Linux/macOS test script)
- Created `test_compiler.bat` (Windows test script)
- Updated README with installation and testing instructions

## üéØ Current Capabilities

The Aero compiler can now successfully:

1. **Parse and compile** advanced Aero programs with:
   - Variable declarations with mutability (`let x = 10;`, `let mut y = 5;`)
   - Function definitions with parameters and return types (`fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32`)
   - Function calls with type checking and validation
   - Control flow statements (if/else, while loops, for loops, infinite loops)
   - Break and continue statements with proper validation
   - I/O operations (`print!("Hello {}!", name)`, `println!("Result: {}", value)`)
   - Arithmetic expressions with automatic type promotion
   - Comparison operations (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
   - Logical operations (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
   - Unary operations (negation)
   - Advanced scoping with variable shadowing

2. **Generate executable programs** that:
   - Define and call functions with proper parameter passing
   - Execute control flow logic correctly
   - Print formatted output using printf integration
   - Perform all arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations
   - Handle complex nested scopes and variable lifetimes
   - Return proper exit codes

3. **Provide a complete development experience**:
   - `aero build file.aero -o output.ll` - Compile to LLVM IR
   - `aero run file.aero` - Compile and execute directly
   - Comprehensive semantic analysis with detailed error reporting
   - Full type checking for all language constructs
   - Function signature validation and arity checking
   - Format string validation for I/O operations

## üìã What's Missing (Future Phases)

### Phase 3 Remaining Tasks
