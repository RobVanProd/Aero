## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aero-lang/aero.git
cd aero
```

2. Build the compiler:
```bash
cd src/compiler
cargo build --release
```

3. Add to PATH (optional):
```bash
# Add the target/release directory to your PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release
```

### Your First Aero Program

Create a file called `hello.aero`:

```aero
fn greet(name: &str) -> () {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}

fn main() {
    let name = "World";
    greet(name);
    
    // Demonstrate control flow
    let mut count = 0;
    while count < 5 {
        if count % 2 == 0 {
            println!("{} is even", count);
        } else {
            println!("{} is odd", count);
        }
        count = count + 1;
    }
}
```

Compile and run:
```bash
aero run hello.aero
```

Or compile to LLVM IR:
```bash
aero build hello.aero -o hello.ll
```

## Language Examples

### Function Definitions
```aero
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}

fn factorial(n: i32) -> i32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

### Control Flow
```aero
fn main() {
    // If/else statements
    let x = 10;
    if x > 5 {
        println!("x is greater than 5");
    } else {
        println!("x is 5 or less");
    }
    
    // While loops
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < 3 {
        println!("Iteration: {}", i);
        i = i + 1;
    }
    
    // For loops
    for j in 0..5 {
        if j == 3 {
            break;
        }
        println!("For loop: {}", j);
    }
}
```

### I/O Operations
```aero
fn main() {
    let name = "Aero";
    let version = 3;
    
    print!("Welcome to ");
    println!("{} v0.{}!", name, version);
    
    let a = 15;
    let b = 4;
    println!("{} + {} = {}", a, b, a + b);
    println!("{} * {} = {}", a, b, a * b);
}
```

## Getting Started

Ready to try Aero? Hereâ€™s how to get started:

### Installation

To use Aero, you'll first need to install its compiler, `aero`. The compiler is written in Rust, so you'll need Rust and Cargo installed. You'll also need LLVM tools (`llc` and `clang`) for compilation.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Install Rust and Cargo:**
   Visit [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install LLVM tools:**
   - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install llvm clang`
   - **macOS:** `brew install llvm` (or use Xcode command line tools)
   - **Windows:** Download from [LLVM releases](https://releases.llvm.org/) or use `winget install LLVM.LLVM`

#### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Aero Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RobVanProd/Aero.git
    cd Aero
    ```

2.  **Install the Aero Compiler:**
    From the root directory of the Aero project, run:
    ```bash
    cargo install --path src/compiler
    ```
    This command builds the `aero` binary from the source code in `src/compiler/` and installs it into your Cargo binary directory (usually `~/.cargo/bin/`).

3.  **Verify Installation:**
    Ensure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your system's `PATH`. Then, open a new terminal session and type:
    ```bash
    aero --help
    ```
    This should display the Aero compiler help message.

#### Testing the Installation

To verify that everything is working correctly, you can run the test suite:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x test_compiler.sh
./test_compiler.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
test_compiler.bat
```

The test suite will build the compiler and run several example programs to ensure everything is working correctly.

### Your First Aero Program

Let's create a simple program that demonstrates Aero's current capabilities.

1.  Create a file named `example.aero` with the following content:
    ```aero
    // example.aero - Demonstrates Phase 3 Aero features
    
    fn greet(name: &str) {
        println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    }
    
    fn calculate_factorial(n: i32) -> i32 {
        if n <= 1 {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return n * calculate_factorial(n - 1);
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        println!("=== Aero Language Demo ===");
        
        // Variables and mutability
        let x = 10;
        let mut y = 5;
        y = y + 3;
        
        println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
        
        // Function calls
        greet("Aero Developer");
        
        // Control flow and recursion
        let fact = calculate_factorial(5);
        println!("5! = {}", fact);
        
        // Loops
        let mut i = 0;
        while i < 3 {
            print!("Count: {} ", i);
            i = i + 1;
        }
        println!("");
        
        println!("Demo complete!");
    }
    ```

This program showcases:
- Function definitions with parameters and return types
- Variable declarations with mutability control
- I/O operations with formatted printing
- Control flow (if/else statements)
- Loops (while loops)
- Recursion and function calls

### What's Currently Working

Aero can currently compile and run programs with these features:

**Variables and Mutability:**
```aero
let x = 42;           // Immutable integer variable
let mut y = 3.14;     // Mutable float variable
y = y + 1.0;          // Reassignment to mutable variable
let z = x + y;        // Mixed arithmetic with type promotion
```

**Functions:**
```aero
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}

fn greet(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}

fn main() {
    let result = add(5, 3);
    greet("World");
}
```

**Control Flow:**
```aero
// If/else statements
if x > 0 {
    println!("Positive");
} else if x < 0 {
    println!("Negative");
} else {
    println!("Zero");
}

// While loops
let mut i = 0;
while i < 5 {
    println!("Count: {}", i);
    i = i + 1;
}

// Infinite loops with break/continue
loop {
    if condition {
        break;
    }
    continue;
}
```

**I/O Operations:**
```aero
print!("Hello ");           // Print without newline
println!("World!");         // Print with newline
println!("Value: {}", 42);  // Formatted printing
println!("Sum: {}", a + b); // Expression formatting
```

**Enhanced Type System:**
```aero
// Comparison operators
let equal = (a == b);
let not_equal = (a != b);
let less = (a < b);
let greater = (a > b);

// Logical operators
let and_result = (true && false);
let or_result = (true || false);
let not_result = !true;
```

### Compiling and Running

There are two main ways to compile and run your Aero programs:

1.  **Build then Run:**
    First, compile your program into an executable:
    ```bash
    aero build example.aero -o example_executable
    ```
    This creates an executable file named `example_executable`. You can then run it:
    -   On Linux/macOS: `./example_executable`
    -   On Windows: `.\example_executable.exe`

2.  **Compile and Run Directly:**
    For convenience, you can compile and immediately run your program with a single command:
    ```bash
    aero run example.aero
    ```

The program will execute and return an exit code of 13 (the result of 10 + 3.5, truncated to integer). You can check the exit code with:
- Linux/macOS: `echo $?`
- Windows: `echo %ERRORLEVEL%`
